# Business Problem :

BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has seen a significant decrease in revenue due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The current market conditions present a challenging environment for the company to thrive. As a result, BoomBikes is developing a strategic business plan to boost its revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers.

The company aims to:

- Understand the post-quarantine demand for shared bikes across the nation by developing a linear model.
- Identify the variables that impact their revenue, i.e., determining the significant factors predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- Assess the accuracy of the model and how effectively these variables predict bike demand.

This approach is designed to prepare BoomBikes to meet public demand once conditions improve, distinguishing themselves from competitors and maximizing profits.

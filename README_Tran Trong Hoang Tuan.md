# Business Problem :

Your task is to model the demand for shared bikes using the available independent variables. This model will help management understand how demand varies with different features. They can then adjust their business strategy to meet demand and satisfy customer expectations. Additionally, this model will provide management with valuable insights into the demand dynamics of a new market.
